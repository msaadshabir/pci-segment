# pci-segment Development Roadmap

> **Last Updated**: October 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

pci-segment is **partially production-ready**. The cloud integration features (AWS/Azure) are production-grade and can be deployed today. However, the Linux eBPF host-based enforcement is incomplete and requires additional development before use in regulated environments.

### Production Readiness Status
