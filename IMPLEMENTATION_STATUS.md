## Detailed Feature Comparison

### [OK] **Section 3.1: PCI-DSS Policy Engine** - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

| Design Doc Feature               | Implementation Status | Location                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Pre-built PCI policies           | [OK] Done             | `examples/policies/*.yaml`         |
| Policy validation                | [OK] Done             | `pkg/policy/engine.go::Validate()` |
| PCI-DSS v4.0 compliance checking | [OK] Done             | Validates Req 1.2, 1.3             |
| Wildcard detection (0.0.0.0/0)   | [OK] Done             | `hasWildcardAccess()`              |
| Label validation (pci-env: cde)  | [OK] Done             | `hasProperCDELabel()`              |
| YAML parsing                     | [OK] Done             | Uses `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`            |

**Evidence:**

```go
// pkg/policy/engine.go
func (e *Engine) Validate(policy *Policy) ValidationResult {
    // Checks API version, PCI annotations, CDE labels
    // Detects 0.0.0.0/0 violations
    // Validates against PCI-DSS Req 1.2/1.3
}
```

### [PARTIAL] **Section 3.2: OS-Native Enforcement** - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

| OS              | Design Doc    | Implementation Status | Notes                                 |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Linux eBPF**  | [OK] Required | [PARTIAL] Stub Only   | Structure in place, needs eBPF C code |
| **macOS pf**    | [OK] Required | [OK] Fully Done       | Generates pf rules, loads anchors     |
| **Windows WFP** | Phase 2       | [NO] Not Started      | Marked as Phase 2 in design           |

**What's Working:**

- [OK] `PFEnforcer` (macOS): Generates pf rules, writes anchors, enforcement lifecycle
- [OK] Interface-based design allows easy Linux implementation later
- [OK] Enforcement events logging structure

**What's Missing:**

- [NO] Linux: Actual eBPF bytecode loading and attachment
- [NO] Linux: BPF maps for policy rules
- [NO] Linux: Cgroup attachment logic

**Current Linux Implementation:**

```go
// pkg/enforcer/ebpf_linux.go
type EBPFEnforcer struct {
    // Structure exists but enforcement is stubbed
    // Needs: libbpf, eBPF C code, kernel interaction
}
```

## Architecture Alignment

### Design Document Architecture:

```
Policy YAML  Policy Engine  OS Enforcer (eBPF/pf)

         Cloud Integrator    Compliance Reporter
```

### Actual Implementation:

```
 Policy YAML   Policy Engine   OS Enforcer (pf , eBPF )

             Cloud Integrator     Compliance Reporter
            (Phase 2)
```

**Architecture is correct, cloud integration deferred to Phase 2 as planned.**

## Gaps Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Blocking Production Linux Use)

1. **Linux eBPF**: Only stub implementation
   - **Impact:** Cannot enforce on Linux in production
   - **Effort:** 2-3 weeks (eBPF C code + libbpf integration)
   - **Workaround:** Use iptables wrapper (lower performance)

### Non-Critical Gaps (Phase 2 Features)

1. **Cloud Integration:** AWS/Azure not implemented

   - **Impact:** Manual cloud security group management
   - **Effort:** 1-2 weeks per cloud provider

2. **PDF Reports:** Only HTML/JSON

   - **Impact:** Need manual HTMLPDF conversion
   - **Effort:** 1 week (library integration)

3. **Real-time Monitoring:** No live dashboard
   - **Impact:** Use log files instead
   - **Effort:** 2-3 weeks (metrics + dashboard)

---
